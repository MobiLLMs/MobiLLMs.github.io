Please follow the guidelines below when preparing your submission for the Workshop on Mobile
Computing with Large Language Models (MobiLLMs).

## Important Dates

* Submission Deadline: April 12, 2024
* Notification of Acceptance: April 19, 2024
* Camera Ready Deadline: May 1, 2024

## Submission Types

MobiLLMs solicits two types of submissions.

#### 5-page technical or position papers

We solicit submissions that present the results of original research best described in a short,
5-page paper. We also welcome position papers that describe early-stage work, preliminary results,
and novel ideas that have the potential to stimulate interesting discussions at the workshop.
Submissions should be no longer than 5 pages, including all text, figures, and tables, but excluding
references. Bibliographic references can be as many pages as necessary.

#### 2-page extended abstracts for demos and work-in-progress reports

We also solicit submissions of 2-page extended abstracts for demos and work-in-progress reports. The
extended abstracts should describe the content and goals of the demo or work-in-progress report. The
abstracts should be no longer than 2 pages, including all text, figures, and tables, but excluding
references. Bibliographic references can be as many pages as necessary.

For demos, the title of the extended abstract should start with `Demo:`. For work-in-progress
reports, the title should start with `WiP:`.

## Submission Instructions

* Submissions must be in PDF. We will not accept papers in any other formats, including Postscript
  and MS-Word.
* For demos, the title of the extended abstract should start with `Demo:`. For work-in-progress
  reports, the title should start with `WiP:`. There are no such requirements for technical or
  position papers.
* Submissions ***must include*** author names and affiliations. We use ***single-blind*** reviewing,
  so authors should include their names and affiliations on the first page of the submission.
* We use the same formatting guidelines as MobiSys.
    * Font size no smaller than 10 points.
    * Use single-spaced and numbered pages, including figures, tables, any appendices, and any other
      material, followed by as many pages as necessary for bibliographic references.
    * Double column format with each column having dimensions 9.25 inches x 3.33 inches, a space of
      0.33 inches between the two columns, and with no more than 55 lines of text per column.
    * Fit properly on US letter-sized paper (8.5 inches by 11 inches).
* [The ACM templates that MobiSys uses](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) are
  useful for formatting compliance. For Latex users, please use
  `\documentclass[sigconf,10pt]{acmart}`.

## Co-Organized with EdgeFM 2024

To create synergy and foster collaboration, MobiLLMs 2024 is co-organized with [the 1st
International Workshop on Edge and Mobile Foundation Models (EdgeFM
2024)](https://edgefm.github.io). The two workshops will *jointly* review submitted papers and
decide on which workshop is the best fit for each paper. The workshops will also collaborate on the
organization of the programs, such as invited talks and the development of the schedule for each
workshop. This is to maximize the opportunity for participants to attend and engage in both
workshops and to foster discussions on the intersection of mobile computing, edge computing, large
language models, and other foundation models.

## Submission Site

Since MobiLLMs 2024 is co-organized with EdgeFM 2024, both workshops use the same submission site.
Please [submit your paper here](https://edgefm24-mobillms24.hotcrp.com/).

## Mandatory Registration

At least one author of an accepted paper is expected to register for the conference and present the
paper in-person.
