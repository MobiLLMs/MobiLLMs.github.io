## Call for Participation

We are pleased to introduce the first "Workshop on Mobile Computing with Large Language Models
(MobiLLMs)", a new forum for discussing the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the
context of mobile computing. This workshop aims to provide a collaborative environment for
researchers, industry professionals, and enthusiasts to share insights, discuss challenges, and
explore the potential of LLMs in mobile computing.

MobiLLMs takes a broad view on LLMs and embraces a wide spectrum of language models such as
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). It is intended as a platform for thoughtful exchange and in-depth
discussion on key aspects of mobile computing and LLMs. Participants will engage in panel
discussions that provide insights into current issues, paper presentations that highlight the latest
research, and demos that demonstrate the practical applications of LLMs in the mobile computing
landscape. Interactive sessions will allow participants to engage with the latest developments, and
networking opportunities are designed to foster connections and collaborations.

We invite submissions of original research that addresses the interface between Large Language
Models and mobile computing. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:

* Effective Deployment of LLMs on Mobile Devices
* Energy and Resource Management for Mobile LLMs
* Real-Time Language Processing in Mobile Environments
* Enhancing Mobile User Experience through LLMs
* Privacy Considerations in Mobile LLM Implementations
* Context-Aware LLM Applications for Mobile Devices
* Challenges of LLMs in Mobile Settings
* LLMs for Mobile Accessibility and Assistive Technologies
* Stability and Reliability of LLMs on Mobile Platforms
* Automated Development of Mobile Applications via LLMs
* Mobile Sensing Data Analysis through LLMs

Submissions can include technical papers, work-in-progress papers, position papers, or proposals for
short talks, demos, and panel discussions.
