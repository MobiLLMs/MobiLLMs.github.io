## Call for Participation

We are pleased to introduce the first "Workshop on Mobile Computing with Large Language Models
(MobiLLMs)", a new forum for discussing the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the
context of mobile computing. This workshop aims to provide a collaborative environment for
researchers, industry professionals, and enthusiasts to share insights, discuss challenges, and
explore the potential of LLMs in mobile computing.

MobiLLMs takes a broad view on LLMs and embraces a wide spectrum of language models such as
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). It is intended as a platform for thoughtful exchange and in-depth
discussion on key aspects of mobile computing and LLMs. Participants will engage in panel
discussions that provide insights into current issues, paper presentations that highlight the latest
research, and demos that demonstrate the practical applications of LLMs in the mobile computing
landscape. Interactive sessions will allow participants to engage with the latest developments, and
networking opportunities are designed to foster connections and collaborations.

We invite submissions of original research that addresses the interface between Large Language
Models and mobile computing. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:

* Effective Deployment of LLMs on Mobile Devices
* Energy and Resource Management for Mobile LLMs
* Real-Time Language Processing in Mobile Environments
* Enhancing Mobile User Experience through LLMs
* Privacy Considerations in Mobile LLM Implementations
* Context-Aware LLM Applications for Mobile Devices
* Challenges of LLMs in Mobile Settings
* LLMs for Mobile Accessibility and Assistive Technologies
* Stability and Reliability of LLMs on Mobile Platforms
* Automated Development of Mobile Applications via LLMs
* Mobile Sensing Data Analysis through LLMs

Submissions can include technical papers, position papers, or extended abstracts for demos and
work-in-progress reports. For more details, please refer to the [our submission
instructions](/submission/).

## Co-Organized with EdgeFM 2024

To create synergy and foster collaboration, MobiLLMs 2024 is co-organized with the 1st International
Workshop on Edge and Mobile Foundation Models (EdgeFM 2024). The two workshops will *jointly* review
submitted papers and decide on which workshop is the best fit for each paper. The workshops will
also collaborate on the organization of the programs, such as invited talks and the development of
the schedule for each workshop. This is to maximize the opportunity for participants to attend and
engage in both workshops and to foster discussions on the intersection of mobile computing, edge
computing, large language models, and other foundation models.
